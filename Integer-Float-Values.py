# Now, We did a basic integer task and we checked which what's the type with using the 'type' command
Number1 = 20
Number2 = 10
result = Number1 + Number2
print(result)
print(type(result))

# Now, We will do float value, as you have seen following

float1 = 22.58
float2 = 12.28
result2 = float1 / float2
print(result2)
print(type(result2))
